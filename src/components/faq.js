                It will cut down on the time that I am at your home and give me more time to clean if the rooms that are going to be cleaned are picked up. Picking up floors and decluttering counters in bathrooms and in the kitchen. Making sure that dishes are washed and making sure your sink and counter are empty to the best of your ability is appreciated. If you have chosen to have me change sheets on a bed, please have them ready. I will leave the dirty sheets in a designated space in your laundry room.

                Providing me feedback is very important. We all have a different idea on what we consider clean and each client is different. Communicating and double checking that your home and all areas are thoroughly cleaned and to your satisfaction.</p>

                Should you need to cancel please do so within 48 hours of your scheduled cleaning (excluding weekends) this can be done by emailing pixiedustpcs@yahoo.com or by calling (417) 761-4253. If you are utilizing my “move in/move out service” or the “small organization service” a $25 fee will be charged if less notice is given.

                I want to make sure that you are 100% happy with cleaning. If you are not happy or I missed something that you wanted clean please call me so I can fix the issue to your satisfaction. I will correct it and any concerns at no charge. I strive to clean your home to best of my advantage, if more time was needed to ensure everything you want done is done, we can schedule extra time into your service. I love when my clients give me feedback and I work hard to ensure your home is perfectly cleaned every time.

                I am pet friendly and I love meeting your pets! Please let me know in advance if there are in any special instructions on what needs to be done with them while I clean. Some clients like to have their pets put into a kennel while I clean other feel better when they can roam the house.

                    Many of my clients are not home or on vacation when I clean. If you provide a key or garage code to your home, I make sure that only I have access to the key or code, and it kept in a secure box in my office.

                     No! Of course, you can choose to be home, but many clients prefer to be gone while I am there cleaning, if you prefer to be home, I can always work around you.

                     While a tip is not required you may tip if you would like to. If you would like to leave a tip the industry standard is 15-20% you can leave your tip with your payment. Also, a note of appreciation means so much. I greatly appreciate your business.

                    After discussing with you about which notification method you would like for your service reminders (email, text, or phone call) I will send a summary of the service you have chosen. Many clients only choose to have a reminder sent if they are bi-weekly, monthly, or a one time clean.

                    No, I do not do laundry. I like to focus on cleaning your home and typically I have completed cleaning your home before the cycle is finished.

                Each house varies on how long a cleaning will take. I always like to have some extra time with the first initial clean after that service changes to where some items are on a rotating basis. A typical cleaning can be 3.5-4 hours.
