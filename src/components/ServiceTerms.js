                    Pixie Dust Professional Cleaning Services provides all the products and equipment to clean your home. When I can provide cleaners and disinfectants that are nontoxic, I use them. If you would like me to use a particular product, then please provide the product and I will be happy to use it. 
                    Each home that I clean is given its own mopping cloth and microfiber cloths. After each cleaning, the cloths are washed and sanitized and marked for use in your home. I also sanitize my vacuum before use in each client’s home.

For health reasons I will not clean liter boxes, fecal matter or vomit that may be found on the floor. If your pet has an accident it is your responsibility to pick it up.

If it is possible to have these items put away while I am cleaning it would avoid any potential accidents that might happen. Please secure all money, jewelry, credit cards, and check books. I am not responsible for any items that may be missing if they are not locked up or secured.

                I take extra care with your belongings, however regrettably and although not common from time to time, something gets broken or damaged. If there is an item believed to be damaged please let me know so we can discuss it. If I damage anything while cleaning, I will notify you immediately. In the event an item is damaged or broken, I reserve the option to repair or replace the item.
I cannot take responsibility for items that were broken because they were not properly attached or secured (for examples, a hanging picture that was improperly attached to the wall or an item that is propped against a surface, scratches to hard surface/hardwood floors with furniture that doesn’t have proper felt pads or something preventing scratches when being moved to clean around/under).

I will not move or pull out appliances (for example washer/dryer/ couches, fridge, and stove). I will not move any furniture that hold electronics. You always have the choice to move these items yourself so that the area behind them can be cleaned but you are responsible for moving them back.
